        <p>
          When it comes to building products, I believe in immersing myself
          alongside clients throughout the process. By working collaboratively
          as a team, our initial focus is always on understanding and addressing
          the needs of the users. Through thoughtful brainstorming and iterative
          prototyping, we continuously test our ideas to validate our
          assumptions.

          My current specialization lies in Web3, specifically NFT and DeFi
          products. I have a strong track record of delivering efficient and
          highly responsive applications crafted using cutting-edge frameworks
          and serverless technologies.
